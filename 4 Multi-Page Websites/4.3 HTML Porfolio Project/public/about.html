<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello there, I'm Kerem. While making this project(in 2025), I am a prep
  student who tries to improve my English in METU Ankara. Next year I am going
  to start my department which is Computer Engineering. I'm also trying to learn
  things related to my department so that's why I'm here.
</p>

<p>
  Nowadays I am really active on Github because I am following 2 courses in
  Udemy at the same time(Python BootCamp and Web Dev Course) and I am publishing
  my daily works to there.
</p>

<p>
  End of this courses I am aiming to be a Full Stack Web Developer who can
  design websites by myself and to be professional in Python. Other than these
  goals, I am also planning learning Mobile App development. For now thats all,
  thanks for reading :D
